# Agent Task Manager Testing and Integration Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy and integration plan for the Agent Task Manager (ATM) project. It aims to ensure the quality, stability, and reliability of the system.

## 2. Testing Strategy

### 2.1. Types of Testing

*   **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components and functions in isolation. We will use Vitest for unit testing.
*   **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between different components and services. This will involve testing the communication between the API, database, and background processes.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Testing the entire application flow from start to finish, simulating user interactions. We will use a suitable E2E testing framework (e.g., Cypress or Playwright) for this. 
*   **Performance Testing:** Evaluating the performance of the application under various loads. We will use tools to simulate user traffic and monitor response times, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
*   **Security Testing:** Assessing the security vulnerabilities of the application, including input validation, authentication, authorization, and data protection.

### 2.2. Test Environment Setup

*   **Development Environment:** Local environment for developers to write and test code.
*   **Staging Environment:** A replica of the production environment for integration and E2E testing.
*   **Production Environment:** The live environment where the application is deployed.

### 2.3. Testing Tools and Frameworks

*   **Unit Testing:** Vitest
*   **Integration Testing:** Vitest (with mocking and stubbing as needed) and potentially a dedicated integration testing framework.
*   **End-to-End Testing:** [To be decided, e.g., Cypress or Playwright]
*   **Performance Testing:** [To be decided, e.g., JMeter, LoadView, or a cloud-based load testing service]
*   **Security Testing:** [To be decided, e.g., OWASP ZAP, or other SAST/DAST tools]

### 2.4. Test Data Management

*   Use of test data generators and seed data to create realistic test scenarios.
*   Database seeding scripts to populate test data.
*   Data masking and anonymization for sensitive data.

### 2.5. Testing Schedule and Frequency

*   **Unit Tests:** Run automatically on every code change and during pull requests.
*   **Integration Tests:** Run after code merges and before deployments to staging.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Run periodically on staging and before production deployments.
*   **Performance Tests:** Conducted periodically, especially before major releases or changes.
*   **Security Tests:** Conducted periodically, and after any security-related code changes.

### 2.6. Metrics for Test Coverage and Quality

*   Code coverage reports to measure the percentage of code covered by unit tests.
*   Number of tests passed/failed.
*   Defect density (number of defects per line of code).
*   Performance metrics (response times, throughput).

## 3. Integration Plan

### 3.1. Components and Services

The Agent Task Manager consists of the following components and services:

*   API (Express.js)
*   Database (PostgreSQL)
*   Webhook Processing Service
*   Background Worker Service (e.g., using BullMQ or similar)
*   User Interface (UI - not within scope, but will interact with the API)

### 3.2. Integration Points

*   **API <-> Database:**  CRUD operations for issues, boards, epics, and webhooks.
*   **API <-> Webhook Processing Service:**  API endpoints to trigger webhook events and receive responses.
*   **API <-> Background Worker Service:**  Enqueuing and dequeuing tasks for background processing.
*   **Webhook Processing Service <-> Database:** Reading and writing data related to webhook events.
*   **Background Worker Service <-> Database:** Reading and writing data for background tasks.
*   **UI <-> API:** (Out of scope, but important) The UI will interact with the API to display and manage tasks.

### 3.3. Integration Testing Procedures

*   **API <-> Database:** Test database interactions with the API. Verify data is stored and retrieved correctly.
*   **API <-> Webhook Processing Service:** Test the successful delivery and processing of webhook events. Verify the appropriate responses are returned to the calling systems.
*   **API <-> Background Worker Service:** Test the enqueueing and processing of background tasks. Verify tasks are completed successfully and data is updated as expected.
*   **Webhook Processing Service <-> Database:** Test the correct handling of webhook events and data persistence to the database.
*   **Background Worker Service <-> Database:**  Test the correct processing of background tasks and data persistence to the database.

### 3.4. Deployment and Configuration

*   Use of a containerization platform (e.g., Docker) for consistent deployments.
*   Configuration management using environment variables.
*   Automated deployment pipelines using CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).

### 3.5. Rollback Strategy

*   Regular backups of the database.
*   Ability to roll back to a previous version of the application.
*   Monitoring of application performance and error rates to detect issues early.
*   Mechanisms to disable or revert specific features quickly.

## 4. Documentation

*   This document will be version controlled.
*   API documentation will be generated using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
*   Code comments and documentation within the code.

## 5. Version Control

*   All code and documentation will be stored in a Git repository.
*   Use of branches for feature development and pull requests for code reviews.
